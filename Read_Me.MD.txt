Further I've embedded the Extext Spart Report, when run from TestRunner class by giving the Tag Name, it will generate the report.

For the Failed Test Case, it will take the Snapshot and embedded that Snapshot in the Report also.

Implemented the WebDriverManager, no need for .exe driver file.

Supported PARALLEL EXECUTION, can run multiple scenarios Simultaneously.
